I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a religion that originated in Japan. 
-The word "Shinto" comes from the Chinese characters for "way" or "path." 
-Shinto is a polytheistic religion, which means that it worships multiple gods and goddesses. 
-The main deities in Shinto are the kami, which can be nature spirits, animals, or humans who have become deified. 
-The kami are believed to inhabit everything in the natural world, from rivers and mountains to trees and stones. 
-People who practice Shinto believe that everything in the world has a kami, and that these kami can help or hinder human endeavors. 
-Shinto is closely linked to the natural world, and many of its ceremonies and practices involve nature. 
-One of the most important aspects of Shinto is the use of torii gates. 
-Torii are gateways that mark the entrance to a sacred space, such as a shrine. 
-They are often made of wood or stone, and they are often red or orange in color. 
-Torii can be found all over Japan, and they are one of the most iconic symbols of the country. 
-People who pass through a torii are believed to be entering the sacred space of the kami, and they are often required to perform a purification ritual before entering. 
-There are many different types of torii, and the most famous ones can be found at the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto.
