I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 1. The History of Shinto: How it began, the development of the religion, and its current status in Japan.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is one of the oldest religions in the world. It began in Japan, and is thought to date back to at least 500 BCE. 
-The word "Shinto" comes from the Chinese characters for "way of the gods". 
-Shinto is a polytheistic religion, which means that it believes in multiple gods and goddesses. These gods and goddesses are called kami. 
-Kami can be anything in nature, such as animals, plants, mountains, rivers, and even human beings. 
-Shinto teaches that everything in the world has a kami, and that kami are to be respected. 
-The most important kami is the sun goddess, Amaterasu. She is considered to be the ancestress of the Japanese people. 
-Shinto is a very naturalistic religion, and its followers believe that humans are born with a pure heart. However, they also believe that humans can be corrupted by impurities, such as greed, anger, and hatred. 
-These impurities can be cleansed through ritual purification, such as washing in a river or taking a bath. 
-Shinto ceremonies are often held outdoors, in places such as forests or mountains. 
-One of the most important Shinto ceremonies is the matsuri, or festival. Matsuri are held to honor the kami, and often involve processions, dances, and the offering of food and drink. 
-Today, Shinto is the religion of about 80% of the Japanese people.
