I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 3. Introduce some of the most famous and popular Shinto shrines and temples in Japan.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

Some of the most famous and popular Shinto shrines and temples in Japan include the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, the Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine in Kamakura, and the Kotohira-gu Shrine in Kochi.

The Meiji Shrine was built in 1920 to honor the Meiji Emperor, who is credited with modernizing Japan. The shrine complex includes a large forest that is a popular spot for picnics and hiking.

The Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine was founded in 1063 and is one of the most popular shrines in Japan. It is dedicated to the deity Hachiman, the god of war. The shrine complex includes a number of beautiful gardens and is a popular spot for weddings.

The Kotohira-gu Shrine is located in the city of Kotohira on the island of Shikoku. It is dedicated to the deity Konpira, the god of sailors and fishermen. The shrine is reached by a long staircase of 785 steps and is famous for its large and impressive main hall.
