I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 1. Add more information on the different types of Shinto shrines and temples.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto shrines are places of worship dedicated to the kami, or gods and goddesses of Shinto belief. 
-There are two types of Shinto shrines: those that enshrine a specific kami, and those that serve as a general place of worship for all kami. 
-The most famous type of Shinto shrine is the Ise Grand Shrine, which is dedicated to the sun goddess Amaterasu. 
-Other popular shrines include the Yasukuni Shrine, dedicated to the war dead, and the Meiji Shrine, dedicated to the emperor Meiji. 
-Shinto temples, on the other hand, are not places of worship but rather places where Shinto priests live and work.
