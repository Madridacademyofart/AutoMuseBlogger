I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-The history of Shinto in Japan is a long and complex one, with various different schools of thought and practice emerging over time. 
-Shinto is traditionally considered to be the indigenous religion of Japan, and has been practised there for centuries. 
-The exact origins of Shinto are unknown, but it is thought to have emerged from a combination of various different religious traditions, including animism, Buddhism, and Taoism. 
-Shinto revolves around the worship of kami, which are spiritual beings that can be found in all aspects of nature. 
-Torii gates are traditionally used to mark the entrance to a Shinto shrine, and are considered to be sacred spaces. 
-Torii gates are usually made from wood or stone, and often have a vermilion colour, which is considered to be auspicious. 
-The first torii gates are thought to have been built in the 8th century, and they have been a key part of Shinto architecture ever since. 
-There are many different types of torii gates, and they can be found all over Japan. 
-Some of the most famous and iconic torii gates can be found at the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto, which is home to thousands of red torii gates.
