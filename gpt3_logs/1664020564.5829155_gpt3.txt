I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 2. Offer a more detailed explanation of the Shinto religion and its beliefs.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a polytheistic religion that originated in Japan.

-Shinto beliefs center around the idea of kami, or spirits, which can be found in everything from natural phenomena to inanimate objects.

-Worship of kami is conducted at shrines, which often feature structures called torii gates.

-The Shinto religion has no formal creed or scripture, but its main principles include the idea that everything in the world has a spirit, that humans are fundamentally good, and that death is not final.
