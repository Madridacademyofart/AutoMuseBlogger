I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 5. Describe the different types of torii gates that can be found in Japan.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-There are two main types of torii gates in Japan: the myōjin torii and the kasuga torii.

-The myōjin torii is the more traditional type of gate, and is often found at Shinto shrines. These gates are usually made from wood, and have two vertical posts with two horizontal beams connecting them at the top.

-The kasuga torii is a newer type of gate, and is often found at Buddhist temples. These gates are usually made from stone, and have two vertical posts with two horizontal beams connecting them at the top.

- There are also many different variations of these two types of gates. For example, some torii gates have three posts, and some have curved beams.
