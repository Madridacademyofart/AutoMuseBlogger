If you want to see torii gates in Japan, the best place to go is the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto. This shrine is home to thousands of torii gates, and it's a really beautiful sight.

Other great places to see torii gates in Japan include the Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima and the Sendai Tanabata Festival in Miyagi.

When visiting any of these shrines or festivals, be sure to dress respectfully and follow the shrine's or festival's rules.
