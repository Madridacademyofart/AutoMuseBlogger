I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a blog post about the history of the printing press. I'd like to know how it influenced religion, politics, and war throughout history and up through the modern age."

SECTION: 1. Origins of the printing press 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-The printing press was invented in the mid-15th century by Johannes Gutenberg in Mainz, Germany. 
-Gutenberg was a goldsmith and gem cutter by trade, and he designed a movable type system that allowed for mass production of printed materials. 
-This system was a marked improvement over earlier printing methods, which were slow and labor-intensive. 
-The printing press quickly spread throughout Europe, and it had a profound impact on the spread of knowledge and the dissemination of information. 
-The press also played a significant role in the Protestant Reformation, as it allowed for the rapid dissemination of religious texts. 
-The printing press has continued to evolve over the centuries, and it remains an important tool for communication and information sharing in the modern age.
