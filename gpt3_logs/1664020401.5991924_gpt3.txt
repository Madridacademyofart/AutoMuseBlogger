I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 1. The History of Shinto: How it began, the development of the religion, and its current status in Japan.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:
