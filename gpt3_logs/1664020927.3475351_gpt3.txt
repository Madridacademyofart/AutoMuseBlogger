I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a religion that originated in Japan. 
-The word "Shinto" means "the way of the gods." 
-Shinto is based on the belief that everything in nature has a spirit, or kami. 
-The first torii gate is thought to have been built in the 8th century, at the entrance to the Grand Shrine of Ise. 
-Torii gates are traditionally made of wood, and they are often red. 
-They are considered to be sacred spaces, and walking through one is thought to be a purifying act. 
-There are many famous torii gates in Japan, including the gates at the Fushimi Inari Shrine and the Itsukushima Shrine.
