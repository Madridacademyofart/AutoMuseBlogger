I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a religion that originated in Japan. 
-The word "Shinto" comes from the Chinese words "shin tao" which means "the way of the gods." 
-Shinto is based on the belief that everything in nature has a spirit or a kami. 
-Kami can be animals, rocks, mountains, trees, rivers, or even people. 
-The most important kami is the sun goddess Amaterasu. 
-Shrines are places where people can go to worship the kami. 
-Torii gates are often found at the entrance to shrines. 
-They are traditionally made of wood and are red in color. 
-Torii gates symbolically mark the boundary between the secular world and the sacred world.
