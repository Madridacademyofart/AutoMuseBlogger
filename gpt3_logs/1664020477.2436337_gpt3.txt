ENGAGING BLOG POST:

Have you ever visited a Shinto shrine? If so, you might have noticed the distinctive torii gates that mark the entrance to many of these sacred spaces. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at the history and meaning of these iconic gates.

The first torii gates are thought to have been built in the 7th century, during the Nara period. These early gates were made of wood and were often located at the entrance of Buddhist temples. It wasn't until the Heian period, however, that torii gates began to be associated with Shinto shrines.

The most famous torii gate is the red torii gate of the Fushimi Inari Taisha shrine in Kyoto. This shrine has thousands of torii gates, which wind up Mount Inari. Other popular torii gates include the orange torii gates of the Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima, and the vermillion torii gates of the Nikko Toshogu Shrine in Tochigi.

So what do these gates represent? Traditionally, they are said to mark the boundary between the mundane world and the sacred space of the shrine. In this way, they function similarly to the gates of a castle or temple.

Today, torii gates can be found all over Japan. They are one of the most iconic symbols of the country, and a visit to a Shinto shrine would not be complete without passing through one of these beautiful gates.
