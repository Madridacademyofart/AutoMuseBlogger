I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 4. Offer a step-by-step guide for building a torii gate.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-A torii gate is a traditional Japanese gate that is most often found at the entrance to a Shinto shrine.

-The first torii gates were likely made of wood and were simple in design.

-Today, torii gates are usually made of wood or stone, and they can be very ornate.

-Building a torii gate is not difficult, but it does require some planning and effort.

-To build a wooden torii gate, you will need:

-4 wooden posts (at least 8 feet tall)

-2 cross beams (at least 10 feet long)

-Nails or screws

-Hammer or drill

-Paint or sealant (optional)

-To build a stone torii gate, you will need:

-4 stone posts (at least 8 feet tall)

-2 cross beams (at least 10 feet long)

-Mortar

-Trowel

-Paint or sealant (optional)

1. Choose a location for your torii gate. It should be at the entrance to a path or driveway, or at the entrance to a garden or other outdoor space.

2. If you are using wooden posts, cut them to the desired height (at least 8 feet tall) and set them in the ground. If you are using stone posts, place them in the ground at the desired height (at least 8 feet tall).

3. Place the cross beams on top of the posts, aligning them so that they are level.

4. If you are using wooden posts, nail or screw the cross beams in place. If you are using stone posts, mortar the cross beams in place.

5. Paint or seal the torii gate, if desired.

6. Stand back and enjoy your handiwork!
