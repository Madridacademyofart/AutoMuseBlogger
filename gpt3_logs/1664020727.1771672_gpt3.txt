I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a religion that originated in Japan. 
-The word "Shinto" means "way of the gods." 
-Shinto is based on the belief that everything in nature has a spirit, or a kami. 
-The kami can be anything from animals and plants to mountains and rivers. 
-People who practice Shinto believe that it is important to respect and worship the kami. 
-One way of doing this is by building shrines, which are places where the kami can be worshipped. 
-Shrines usually have a torii gate at the entrance. 
-The torii gate is a symbol of Shinto and is said to mark the boundary between the human world and the world of the kami. 
-There are many different types of torii gates, but the most common one is made of two vertical posts and two horizontal crossbeams. 
-The torii gate is usually red, which is thought to be a color that attracts the kami. 
-There are many famous and beautiful torii gates in Japan, such as the ones at the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto and the Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima.
