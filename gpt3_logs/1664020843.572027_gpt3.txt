I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a Japanese religion that dates back to the 8th century CE. 
-It is based on the worship of kami, which are natural spirits that inhabit everything from mountains and rivers to trees and stones. 
-The first torii gate was built in the 12th century, and they were originally made of wood. 
-The gates mark the entrance to a sacred space, and they are often found at the entrance to shrines. 
-The most famous torii gate is the one at the entrance to the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto. This shrine is dedicated to the kami of rice and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Japan. 
-There are also many other beautiful and notable torii gates around the country, such as the red gates of the Itsukushima Shrine on Miyajima Island and the vermillion gates of the Nikko Toshogu Shrine.
