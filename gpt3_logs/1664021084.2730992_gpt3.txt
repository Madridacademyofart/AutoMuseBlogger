I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 7. Discuss the importance of Shinto in Japanese culture and how it is practiced today.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is one of the two major religions in Japan 
-It is a polytheistic religion that worships kami, or gods and goddesses 
-Shinto is deeply rooted in the history and culture of Japan 
-It is often seen as a way of life, rather than a religion 
-Shinto is practised today through ceremonies and rituals at shrines, as well as festivals and other events
