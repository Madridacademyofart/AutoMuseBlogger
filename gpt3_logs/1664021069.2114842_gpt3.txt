I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 7. Discuss the importance of Shinto in Japanese culture and how it is practiced today.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

Shinto is an indigenous religion of Japan and was once its state religion. It is a polytheistic religion that revolves around the worship of kami, or gods and goddesses. There are eight million Shinto shrines in Japan, and the religion is still practiced today by around four million people.

Shinto has played an important role in Japanese culture throughout history. It has been used to legitimize the authority of the emperor, and has been used as a tool of nationalism. Today, Shinto is not as politically important as it once was, but it still plays a significant role in Japanese culture. Many Japanese people visit Shinto shrines on important occasions, such as the New Year, and some weddings and funerals are still held according to Shinto traditions.
