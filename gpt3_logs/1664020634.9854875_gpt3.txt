I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a religion that originated in Japan. 
-The word "Shinto" means "way of the gods." 
-Shinto is based on the belief that everything in the world has a kami, or spirit. 
-Kami can be anything from natural phenomena like mountains and rivers, to animals and human beings. 
-Shinto followers believe that it is important to worship the kami in order to maintain harmony in the world. 
-One of the ways Shinto followers do this is by building shrines, which are places where kami are believed to reside. 
-Shrines are typically marked by a torii, or gate. 
-Torii are thought to mark the boundary between the human world and the world of the kami. 
-The first torii is thought to have been built in the 7th century. 
-Today, there are many different types of torii, and they can be found all over Japan.
