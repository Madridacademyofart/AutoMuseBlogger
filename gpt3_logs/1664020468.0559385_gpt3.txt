I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 1. Add more information on the different types of Shinto shrines and temples.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto shrines are places of worship dedicated to the kami, or gods and goddesses of Shinto belief. 
-There are two types of Shinto shrines: jinja and jingu. Jinja shrines are dedicated to a specific kami, while jingu shrines are general shrines for the veneration of all kami. 
-The most famous Shinto shrine is the Ise Jingu in Mie Prefecture, which is dedicated to the goddess Amaterasu. 
-Other popular shrines include the Nikko Toshogu Shrine in Tochigi Prefecture (dedicated to the first Tokugawa shogun, Ieyasu), the Fushimi Inari Taisha in Kyoto (dedicated to the kami Inari), and the Meiji Jingu in Tokyo (dedicated to the Meiji Emperor). 

-Torii gates are traditionally found at the entrance of Shinto shrines. They are said to mark the boundary between the mundane world and the sacred space of the shrine. 
-The first torii gates are thought to have been built in the 7th century, during the Nara period. 
-The most famous torii gate is the red torii gate of the Fushimi Inari Taisha shrine in Kyoto. This shrine has thousands of torii gates, which wind up Mount Inari. 
-Other popular torii gates include the orange torii gates of the Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima, and the vermillion torii gates of the Nikko Toshogu Shrine in Tochigi.
