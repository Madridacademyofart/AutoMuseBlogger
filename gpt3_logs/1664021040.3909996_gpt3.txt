I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a religion that originated in Japan. 
-The word "Shinto" means "the way of the gods." 
-Shinto is based on the belief that everything in the world has a spirit, or a kami. 
-The first recorded mention of Shinto dates back to the 6th century CE. 
-Shinto is not based on any one sacred text, but rather on a body of oral traditions. 
-Shrines are places where people can go to worship the kami. 
-Torii gates are often found at the entrance to shrines. 
-Torii means "bird perch," and these gates are meant to mark the boundary between the sacred and the secular. 
-The first recorded mention of torii gates dates back to the 8th century CE. 
-The most famous torii gate in Japan is the floating torii gate at Itsukushima Shrine.
