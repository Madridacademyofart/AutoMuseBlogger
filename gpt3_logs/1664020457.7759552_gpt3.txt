I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 1. Add more information on the different types of Shinto shrines and temples.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

Shinto shrines are places of worship dedicated to the kami, or gods and goddesses of Shinto. There are two main types of Shinto shrines: torii shrines and jinja shrines. Torii shrines are typically located at the entrance of a Shinto shrine, and they mark the boundary between the sacred and the secular. Jinja shrines are usually located in the center of a town or village, and they are the most important type of Shinto shrine.
