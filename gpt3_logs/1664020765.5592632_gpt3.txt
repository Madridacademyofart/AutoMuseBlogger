I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 4. Offer a step-by-step guide for building a torii gate.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-A torii gate is a traditional Japanese gate found at the entrance of a Shinto shrine.

-The first torii gates were likely made of wood and were placed at the entrance to a sacred space to mark it as such.

-Over time, the design of torii gates has evolved and they are now made from a variety of materials, including stone, paper, and metal.

-Building a torii gate is not a difficult task, but it does require some planning and attention to detail.

-The first step is to gather the materials you will need. This includes the posts, crossbeams, and any decorative elements you wish to add.

-Next, you will need to cut the posts to the correct height and width. It is important to make sure the posts are level and evenly spaced.

-Once the posts are in place, you can add the crossbeams. These should be positioned so that they are level and evenly spaced.

-Finally, you can add any decorative elements, such as carvings or paintings. Once everything is in place, your torii gate is complete!
