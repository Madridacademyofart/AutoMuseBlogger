I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a polytheistic religion that originated in Japan. 
-The word "Shinto" means "the way of the gods." 
-Shinto is based on the belief that everything in the world has a spirit, or kami. 
-Kami can be natural phenomena like mountains, rivers, and trees, or they can be human beings who have done great deeds. 
-The most important kami is the sun goddess, Amaterasu. 
-Shrines are places where kami are worshipped. 
-Shinto priests perform rituals at shrines to please the kami and bring good fortune to the people. 
-One of the most important rituals is the kagura, a sacred dance dedicated to the kami. 
-People also visit shrines to pray for good health, success in business, and other things. 
-There are about 80,000 Shinto shrines in Japan. 
-The first Shinto shrines were built in the 7th century. 
-The oldest existing shrine is the Ise Grand Shrine, which was built in the year 4 BCE. 
-The torii is a traditional Japanese gate that marks the entrance to a shrine. 
-Torii means "bird perch," because the gates were originally made of two posts with a beam across the top, like a perch for birds. 
-Nowadays, torii are made of wood, stone, or metal. 
-They are usually red, because red is considered a sacred color in Shinto. 
-The torii gate is considered to be the boundary between the human world and the world of the kami. 
-There are many famous torii gates in Japan, including the giant gates at the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto.
