I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 3. Introduce some of the most famous and popular Shinto shrines and temples in Japan.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:
