I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a Japanese religion that dates back to the 6th century CE. 
-Shinto means "the way of the gods" and is based on the belief that everything in nature has a spirit or kami. 
-The first torii gate is thought to have been built in the 8th century CE. 
-Torii gates are traditionally made of wood and mark the entrance to a Shinto shrine. 
-They are often red in color and have a distinctive arch shape. 
-The most famous torii gate in Japan is the Itsukushima Shrine in Miyajima.
