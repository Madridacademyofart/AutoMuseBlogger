I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a blog post about the history of the printing press. I'd like to know how it influenced religion, politics, and war throughout history and up through the modern age."

SECTION: 1. Origins of the printing press 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

The printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century and it revolutionized the way information was disseminated. It allowed for books, pamphlets, and other printed materials to be mass-produced quickly and cheaply. The printing press had a profound impact on religion, politics, and war. It helped to spread religious ideas and beliefs throughout Europe and beyond. It also played a role in political revolutions and the spread of democracy. And finally, it was used to print propaganda during times of war.
