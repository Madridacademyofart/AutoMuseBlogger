I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a Japanese religion that dates back to prehistoric times. 
-The word "Shinto" means "the way of the gods." 
-Shinto is based on the belief that everything in the universe has a spirit, or kami. 
-Kami can be natural objects like mountains or rivers, or they can be human beings who have had particularly good or bad lives. 
-People who follow Shinto believe that it is important to respect and worship the kami in order to maintain balance and harmony in the world. 
-One of the most important ways of doing this is through the construction of shrines, which are places where kami can be worshipped. 
-Shrines typically have a gate called a torii, which marks the boundary between the human world and the world of the kami. 
-The first torii is believed to have been built in the 7th century, and they have been used at shrines ever since. 
-Torii are usually made of wood or stone, and they can be very simple or very ornate. 
-They are often red, which is considered to be a sacred color in Shinto. 
-There are many famous and beautiful torii gates in Japan, and they are one of the things that most people associate with the Shinto religion.
