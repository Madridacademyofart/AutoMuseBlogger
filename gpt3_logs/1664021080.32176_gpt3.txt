I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 7. Discuss the importance of Shinto in Japanese culture and how it is practiced today.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

Shinto is an incredibly important part of Japanese culture. It is a religion that is based on the idea of animism, or the belief that everything has a spirit. This means that Shintoists believe that everything from trees and rocks to animals and humans have spirits. Shintoists also believe in kami, or gods and goddesses. These kami are responsible for everything from the sun and the moon to the wind and the rain.

These kami are responsible for everything from the sun and the moon to the wind and the rain. Shintoists believe that it is important to live in harmony with the kami, and they often do this by building shrines and performing rituals. One of the most important Shinto rituals is the purification ritual, which is designed to cleanse people and objects of negative energy.

Shinto is still practiced today, and it is estimated that there are around 4 million Shintoists in Japan. While most Japanese people do not consider themselves to be Shintoists, many still practice some of the traditions, such as visiting shrines on special occasions.
