I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a native religion of Japan and one of the oldest religions in the world. 
-The word "Shinto" means "the way of the gods." 
-Shinto is a polytheistic religion, and its gods, or kami, are natural forces and objects.
-The first torii gate is said to have been built in the 8th century by a Buddhist monk named Kukai. 
-Torii gates are traditionally made of wood, and they mark the entrance to a Shinto shrine. 
-They are often red, and they are considered to be sacred spaces. 
-Some of the most famous torii gates in Japan can be found at the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto and the Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima.
