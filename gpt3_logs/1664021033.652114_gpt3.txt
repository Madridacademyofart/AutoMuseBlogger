I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a polytheistic religion that originated in Japan. 
-The main deities in Shinto are the kami, which are natural spirits that inhabit everything from mountains and rivers to trees and animals. 
-People worship at shrines, which are usually located in natural settings such as forests or mountaintops. 
-Shinto shrines are often marked by a torii, which is a traditional Japanese gate. 
-Torii gates are usually made of wood or stone, and they often have a vermilion color. 
-The purpose of a torii gate is to mark the entrance to a sacred space. 
-There are many famous torii gates in Japan, such as the floating torii gate at Itsukushima Shrine and the red torii gates at Fushimi Inari Shrine.
