I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 5. Describe the different types of torii gates that can be found in Japan.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

There are two main types of torii gates in Japan: the Myojin-type and the Shinmei-type.

The Myojin-type is the more common of the two, and is characterized by its two posts and two lintels. It is often found at the entrance of Shinto shrines.

The Shinmei-type is less common, and is characterized by its two posts and two lintels, but with an additional post in the middle. It is often found at the entrance of Buddhist temples.
