I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 5. Describe the different types of torii gates that can be found in Japan.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

There are many different types of torii gates that can be found in Japan. The most common type is the Shinto torii, which is a traditional gate that is usually made of wood or stone. There are also many different styles of Shinto torii, such as the honden torii, which is a gate that leads to the main shrine building, and the ry≈çbu torii, which has two columns instead of one.

Another type of torii gate is the Buddhist torii, which is often made of metal and is usually found at the entrance to a temple. There are also many different styles of Buddhist torii, such as the karamon torii, which has a decorative roof, and the nio torii, which has two guardian statues called Nio on either side of the gate.

Finally, there are also many modern torii gates, which are often made of concrete or steel. These gates are usually found at the entrance to a park or other public space.
