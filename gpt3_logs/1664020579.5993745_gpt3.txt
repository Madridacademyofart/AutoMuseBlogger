I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 2. Offer a more detailed explanation of the Shinto religion and its beliefs.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Shinto is a polytheistic religion that originated in Japan.

-Shinto beliefs center around the idea of kami, or divine spirits. These spirits can be found in everything from natural objects to human beings.

-People who practice Shinto believe in the power of purification and ritual to cleanse themselves and their surroundings of negative energy.

-Shinto shrines are places where people can go to worship the kami. These shrines are often located in natural settings, such as forests or mountains.

-The torii gate is a symbol of Shinto. It is typically found at the entrance to a shrine.

-The word "torii" means "bird perch," and it is thought that the gates were originally meant to keep birds from entering the shrine.

-The torii gate is also a symbol of the separation between the natural world and the human world.
