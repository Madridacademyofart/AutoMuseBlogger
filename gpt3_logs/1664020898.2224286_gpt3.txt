I have compiled the following research notes. I need to rewrite these notes into a long, professional blog post. It must be engaging and interesting.

RESEARCH:
There are two main types of torii gates in Japan: the Myojin-type and the Shinmei-type.

The Myojin-type is the more common of the two, and is characterized by its two posts and two lintels. It is often found at the entrance of Shinto shrines.

The Shinmei-type is less common, and is characterized by its two posts and two lintels, but with an additional post in the middle. It is often found at the entrance of Buddhist temples.
There are many different types of torii gates that can be found in Japan. The most common type is the Shinto torii, which is a traditional gate that is usually made of wood or stone. There are also many different styles of Shinto torii, such as the honden torii, which is a gate that leads to the main shrine building, and the rybu torii, which has two columns instead of one.

Another type of torii gate is the Buddhist torii, which is often made of metal and is usually found at the entrance to a temple. There are also many different styles of Buddhist torii, such as the karamon torii, which has a decorative roof, and the nio torii, which has two guardian statues called Nio on either side of the gate.

Finally, there are also many modern torii gates, which are often made of concrete or steel. These gates are usually found at the entrance to a park or other public space.
