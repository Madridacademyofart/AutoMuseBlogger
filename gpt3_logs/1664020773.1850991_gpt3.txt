I have the following blog request to write. I am focusing on writing one section at a time. I need to jot down some notes about this section before I proceed.

REQUEST: "I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and torii gates in Japan. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? What are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer."

SECTION: 4. Offer a step-by-step guide for building a torii gate.

Here are my detailed research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this:

==========

-Torii gates are traditionally made from wood, though nowadays they can be made from other materials like stone or concrete. 
-The posts of a torii gate are usually made from whole tree trunks, while the crossbeams are cut from larger branches. 
-Torii gates are usually assembled without the use of nails or other metal fasteners. 
-The building process begins with the selection of the materials. 
-The tree trunks are cut to the desired length and the branches are cut to the desired size. 
-The posts are then set into the ground, and the crossbeams are placed on top of them. 
-The whole structure is then secured using ropes or wires. 
-Once the torii gate is built, it is usually painted in red or black.
