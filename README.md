# AutoMuseBlogger

Automatically generate nonfiction content about any given topic

1. Take a prompt of some sort (natural language instructions) like **"I want a blog about X..."**
2. Brainstorm the structure of the request (list a bunch of sections)
3. Iterate on that list to improve it (is this a good list?)
4. Brainstorm some facts or points to include for each section (repeat this like 2 or 3 times)
5. Write the actual sections
6. Iterate/improve the sections
7. Clean up the final product
